# Calculator

Made as a project from The Odin Project - Foundations curriculum.

[Calculator preview](https://veejaypl.github.io/odin-calculator/)

The calculator has two displays:

1. Memory display - with either the input value or the result of calculation based on the chosen operator and the operator itself
2. Result display

Input value is limited to 11 digits. The result is rounded to 5 decimal points.

## To do list

- rearange the code to be more function based
- fix issue with the operators being pressed without the values
